# React Application Setup

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a tool for setting up a modern React project with a minimal configuration.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
Changes made to the app will automatically reload the page.  
Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in watch mode.  
For more information about running tests, visit the [Create React App Testing Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.  
The build is optimized for performance, and the filenames are hashed for caching purposes.  
Your app is now ready for deployment.

For deployment instructions, refer to the [Create React App Deployment Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Warning**: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot undo this action.  
Running this command will expose all build configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) within your project, allowing full customization of the build process.  
Use this only if you need more control over the configuration.
